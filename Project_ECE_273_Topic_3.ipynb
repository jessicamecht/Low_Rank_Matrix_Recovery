    "The goal of this project is to understand recovery of a low rank matrix from a specifically constrained set of data measurements. In [1] a neural network with a specific underlying data model is shown to be recovered using a non convex iterative algorithm. In [2], a convex relaxation to solve a similar convex problem which can recover a specific rank r matrix with high probability using constrained minimization is shown. This project helps us understand how it is possible to solve a highly non convex problem using an iterative algorithm, which recovers a matrix with high probability given that the data has a specific format. We also learn to understand how to to relax a non convex problem into a convex one which is solvable with computational solvers. Additionally, we learn to understand the preconditions on the data which need to be fulfilled for a system like this to perform well."

    "Many problems in our world can be represented as a suitable matrix. For example, we can represent a low degree statistical model for a random process or a low order controller for a plant as a low rank matrix [11,12]. However, in real life, we never obtain 100% of information and thus always have a limited amount of data. But this data is often meaningful, if we are able to extract relevant patterns from it. Estimating or completing low rank matrices from a given dataset is thus helpful for us to understand data, even though we can only obtain a limited amount of it [1, 3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make use of this problem for several applications. One is signal reconstruction [2], where the authors show that they can reconstruct a matrix from a bounded number of noisy measurements per degree of freedom using different versions of minimization problems [2]. A recovering method like this can also be used for face recognition [5,7], Quantum state tomography [6] and distance measurements [2]. Matrix sensing and completion has also been used for control and system identification [9] as well as collaborative filtering [10]. Soltani and Hegde found a way to provably recover learning parameters using low rank matrix estimation for learning a neural network of a specific form which learns a specific data distribution [1]. Because of the broad applicability of low-rank matrices this topic is important to a broad community of data scientists and mathematicians, as well as companies (among others used for the famous million dollar Netflix challenge). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using heuristic non convex iterative algorithms like in [1] to solve low rank estimation problems can be helpful with respect to runtime. Even though convex solutions offer an optimal solution, it can require exponential running time [3]. Thus, an iterative algorithm which recovers a low rank matrix can be helpful in real life, where we have limited computing time and power. "

So if we minimize the nuclear norm of $L$ we get a minimum solution of the problem. If we now analyse the constraint that the the largest singular value of the estimation of $A^*(e)$, which is the estimation of $L$ weighted with the misprediction error for each data sample, is smaller than some constant $\\lambda$. It is a suitable convex relaxation because it recovers $L$ with a limited error and thus we can reconstruct $y$ in (2) with the $L$ obtained in (3)."

    "The methods in this project are two fold. On the one hand, we have a non convex learning algorithm which provides an understandable recovery of a matrix. There are different versions available with different computational efficiencies [1]. We use the less computational efficient method, but whose interpretation is intuitive. This method estimates a matrix L by iterating through the average of the dot product of the data features in batches and multiplying it with the difference of the prediction with the real label (error term). This error lerm uses the current L_t matrix to preduct from the data samples and compares it with the actual ground truth label. This kind of resembles a loss function which is regularly used in learning neural networks. The new 'weights' matrix L_t is then updated by the projection onto the subspace of all rank r matrices of the difference of L_t-1 with this average and a weighted bias term, which is novel in the work provided by [1]. The bias term is the error of the current prediction minus 0.5 the average ground truth value. Instead of using an error threshold this paper uses a fixed iteration constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we have a convex relaxation of the problem which can be expressed in different ways [2]. The broad idea of the convex relaxation is that we want to minimize the nuclear norm of our variable matrix L under the conditions that the operator norm (largest singular value) of the adjoint operator of the difference between the prediction and the estimation is smaller or equal to a constant lambda. How to choose the constant lambda has been explored in [2] I.4 where, lambda has a special structure which is proved to perform well for a given convex minimization problem. "

This makes sense because the authors in [1] explicitly assumed that their training data is distributed with zero mean and identity covariance. With respect to the parameters, we can see that the parameter p influences the results and probability of success. We can see that the probability of success increases with lower $p$ for smaller batch size $m$. For larger batch sizes, the parameter $p$ does not influence the probability of success so much. We can see that the initialization variance of the ground truth matrix $L_*$ does not influence the results at all.

    "To summarize the findings I commented within the code, there are many advantages as well as limitations with the convex and non convex methods evaluated in this project. First of all, the authors of [1] did an amazing job using a low rank estimation problem for a highly relevant field of provable learning. Their algorithm is understandable when doing some background research on low rank matrix estimation. Their algorithm is very fast, but requires a comparatively big dataset to start with. In this project, 20 batches of 3000 samples lead to good results. The algorithm is based on a specific structure of input data and relation of input data to the labels which the neural network needs to learn. This limits the applicability of the algorithm to real world data. It is dependent on the initialization of the data to be zero mean and identity covariance. Zero mean can be normalized to, but we almost never have identity covariance for the features (or dimensions) of the training data. Also, many problems do not have a clear data to label relationship ($x^TL_*x$). Thus, this algorithm is great for showing that provable learning is possible, but is highly limited to real world with very specific underlying data structures. If those data structures are met, the non convex iterative algorithm produces highly accurate reconstructions of the ground truth matrix and very fast computational efficiency for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the convex relaxation of this project turned out to be sufficiently accurate to reconstruct the ground truth matrix $L_*$, even with few data samples to begin with. However, solving the convex problem was not computationally efficient, especially for numerous training samples or high dimensions. However, the convex approach was able to handle data samples which came from a normal distribution with random mean and covariance and can thus be used for a broader set of problems. It also did a better job learning the binary problem and did not suffer from error explosion for different initializations and data dimensions. \n"
